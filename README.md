**Objective**
Create a CNN model, which can accurately detect detect melanoma and classify 9 classes present in the dataset. 

**Data**
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

**Steps**
Data Reading/Data Understanding 
Dataset visualisation
Model Building & training : 
Train the model for ~20 epochs
Choose an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training
Train the model for ~20 epochs
Handling class imbalances: Rectify class imbalances present in the training dataset with Augmentor library.
Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data
